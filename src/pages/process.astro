                    <p>
                        We start by reviewing your current website or discussing
                        your needs if you don’t have one yet. This helps us
                        understand what’s working, what’s not, and what will
                        actually help your business.

                        Based on the review, we recommend the right approach and
                        send a clear proposal outlining scope, expectations, and
                        next steps.

                    you through the process and recommend what makes sense; not
